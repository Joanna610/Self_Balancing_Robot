# Self_Balancing_Robot

The projects include code for Arduino. It collects data from the acceleromiter MPU6050 and modifies them accordingly. The code also turn on and off the motors with PWM. It can do this thanks to H bridge - L293D. The robot try to stabilize itself due to implemented PID algorithm.
